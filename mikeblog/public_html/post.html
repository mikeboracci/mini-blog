            <p>I never expected to be going to school in my 50's but this is a modern world that is ever changing,
            highly technical, and media driven, and you have to keep up or you will end up working in a thankless
            job. I had gone to a technical school in 1984 and learned about robotics,
            electronics, and other technologies. That education drove my career for 30 years, but at my age those technologies had reached their limit in terms of
            driving my career. I needed modern technical skills quickly, because I want to live the rest of my life in control of
            my own career.
        </p>
        
        <p>After working hard in technology at the hardware level, I moved into sales and marketing of technology products
            in the early 90's, just after the Internet was born. Sales did not really fit my personality type at all but I was
            very good at it despite myself. I enjoyed the science behind marketing technologies and continue to work in the field
            as a consultant. By the late 90's it was apparent that the Internet was the future of all things commerce and information. I wanted to
            be a part of it, so I started creating my first pure HTML websites and jumped into Drupal development with both feet. For the next 15 years
            I worked hard at my Drupal skills and continued to build websites. Things change on the Internet at a rapid pace as the open source community
            grinds away at improving and building upon what has come before. I knew that my career had already passed it's peak and I had to make some changes
            to ensure that I had a good run for the next 20+ years. 
        </p>
        
        <p>After being laid-off from a position as marketing manager, I decided that the time was right to take action and look at educating myself as a way to change careers.
            I am very happy that I decided to start learning again and Hunter Business School had the right Full-Stack web development course for me. I wanted a stack that focused on the open-source world which is what the overwhelming majority of the web runs on. I have a good background in 
            Linux, SQL, HTML, CSS and some minor programming, but learning everything again and adding to my existing knowledge is giving me the feeling 
            that I have the power to create a new future for myself and my family. Growth in the general field of web development is projected at around 15% through 2026 which is very encouraging. Specific disciplines have shown as high as 29% growth projection for the same time period.
            I see many possibilities with all of this new knowledge. The web is an unlimited thing and even the IOT can be tied into the knowledge base that I am getting from school.
